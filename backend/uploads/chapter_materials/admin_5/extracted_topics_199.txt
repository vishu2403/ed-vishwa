1. Introduction
Statistical simulation refers to the use of random sampling techniques to model and analyze complex systems or stochastic processes. It helps approximate results that are otherwise difficult to compute analytically.

2. Motivation
Analytical solutions to real‑world problems are often infeasible due to their mathematical complexity. Statistical simulation allows us to understand uncertainty, test hypotheses, and evaluate the performance of statistical estimators.

3. Basic Concepts
- Random number generation using probability distributions: Statistical simulation begins with generating random numbers that follow specified probability distributions.
- Sampling from populations or theoretical distributions: It involves drawing samples either from actual populations or from theoretical distribution models.
- Repeated trials to approximate expected values: By conducting many repeated trials, the simulation approximates expected values of interest.
- Using simulation outcomes for inference and prediction: The results of the simulation are then used for statistical inference and making predictions.

4. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Example: Estimation of π using random points inside a unit square. Steps: 1. Generate N random points (x, y) in [0,1] × [0,1]. 2. Count how many fall inside the unit circle (x² + y² < 1). 3. Estimate π as 4 × (points inside circle) / N.
- Python Example: 
```python
import numpy as np
N = 1000000
x = np.random.rand(N)
y = np.random.rand(N)
pi_est = 4 * np.sum(x**2 + y**2 <= 1) / N
print("Estimated π:", pi_est)
```
This code generates one million random points, checks which lie inside the unit circle, and computes an estimate of π.

5. Bootstrapping
- Example: Estimating confidence interval for mean. Steps: 1. Draw B bootstrap samples (with replacement) from data. 2. Compute the mean for each sample. 3. Use the distribution of means to estimate standard error and confidence intervals.
- Python Example: 
```python
import numpy as np
data = np.array([12, 7, 9, 15, 11, 8, 10])
B = 1000
means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(data, size=len(data), replace=True)) for _ in range(B)]
conf_interval = (np.percentile(means, 2.5), np.percentile(means, 97.5))
print("95% CI for mean:", conf_interval)
```
The script creates 1,000 bootstrap samples, calculates their means, and derives a 95 % confidence interval for the population mean.

6. Advantages of Statistical Simulation
- Provides flexibility for complex problems: Simulation can be adapted to a wide range of intricate scenarios where analytical methods fail.
- Simplifies uncertainty quantification: Random sampling makes it straightforward to assess variability and uncertainty.
- Enables visual understanding of stochastic processes: Simulated data can be plotted to illustrate the behavior of random systems.
- Applicable across science, finance, and AI: The techniques are useful in many disciplines, from natural sciences to financial modeling and artificial intelligence.

7. Limitations
- Can be computationally intensive: Large numbers of iterations may require substantial computing resources.
- Accuracy depends on number of iterations: More simulation runs generally lead to more precise estimates.
- Random number quality affects results: Poor pseudo‑random number generators can bias the outcomes.

8. Summary
Statistical simulation is a powerful tool for approximating complex models using random sampling. Monte Carlo methods and bootstrapping are foundational techniques that provide insights into uncertainty and sampling behavior.
